<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Nikoloz, I was born in Tbilisi, Georgia, and from an early age, I’ve been passionate about football <br>
Growing up in a city where the sport is deeply rooted in the culture, football became more than just a game for me—it’s a way of life.<br>
Whether playing on the field or cheering from the sidelines, I’ve always found joy and connection through the sport. <br>
Football has taught me teamwork, perseverance, and the importance of never giving up.<br>
Welcome to my world, where my love for the game shines through.</p>
